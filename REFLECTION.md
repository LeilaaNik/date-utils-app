## Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
Chapter 2 of *Clean Code* emphasizes the importance of meaningful and expressive names, which has significantly influenced my approach to naming functions and variables. For example, I revised `addDays()` to `addDaysToGivenDate()` and `validateDays()` to `validateDaysToAdd()`. These changes make the purpose of each function more explicit, improving readability and ensuring the code conveys its intent more effectively. Previously, some function names were too generic, causing confusion about their specific purpose. By following the chapter’s guidelines, I’ve made my code more intuitive and maintainable for others. Here is a screenshot of the improved code for clarity:
